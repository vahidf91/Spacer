# Spacer
Spacer checks free space on defined paths and informs the user about crossing free space limit.
Please place `spacer.sh` inside your `.profile` or `.bash_profile` (based on your distro) and set a threshold (the default treshold is 85% of used space). Whenever the user crosses the threshold on next login he/she will be informed about the danger of crossing space threshold. 

You can also choose wheter to configure a mail server and inform the Administrator about the issue.
